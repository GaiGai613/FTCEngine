# FTCEngine
This is a "robot engine" for the First Tech Challenge competition

To install:
1. Clone/fork the official FTC application
2. Add the engine to the repo as a submodule with: 
```
git submodule add https://github.com/us-robotics/FTCEngine.git TeamCode/src/main/java/FTCEngine
```
3. Done; now you can use the engine under the `FTCEngine` package
